# Spotify Music Releases

The project was to create a page that displays newly released spotify albums in a nice way using React. The data was pulled from a static Spotify API.

I ran into a specific problem with adding a "," at the end of every index in an array. It took quite a while to come up with a solution for this but ultimately I figured out that I could check the length of array with index (The index of the current element being processed in the array.).
